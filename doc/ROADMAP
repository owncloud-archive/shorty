Future versions might implement additional features and services:

* 'live' monitoring for new clicks:
A wheel above the list of clicks. When clicked it starts turning, whilst it is 
turning all clicks reaching the monitored Shorty will be immediately added to
the list currently visualized. Like a heartbeat monitor.

Contributions:
I'd be more than happy to welcome all contributions to this little experiment.
Drop me a note, an idea, a patch, a good bottle of wine, anything !
