 * @description
 * This script codes all most of internal, client side logic implemented by the
 * Shorty app. That logic may be extended by plugins registering into the app.
 * A few internal functions are called via such plugin hooks too, this allows
 * to use a uniform call scheme by plugins and this main app.
