The current status of this package is as follows:

The initial release is definately buggy and contains annoying shortcomings.
It has been developed on a linux system using a firefox browser, so this is
most likely the best working combination. Basic usage test have been made with
a few other browsers. The package appears to be working in general though there
might be some minor differences in apeparance.

Known shortcomings are:
- only very basic input validation is done.
- access control is not yet fine grained, no user or group support exists.
- markup, scripting and style definitions are the work of a web app newbie.

So "sorry for any inconveniences" !
