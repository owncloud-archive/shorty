This "shorty" package implements a plugin for the ownCloud web application.
Shorty offers a service to store, manage and use a collection of short links
pointing to ressources in the web. The features are a combination of a
centralized bookmarks collection, an url shortener and a basic access control.
The collection is presented as a list of "shorties". A shorty can be created
either manually in the list ("New shorty") or by using the "Shortlet". The
Shortlet is something like a Bookmarklet, a script based bookmark meant to be
stored inside the bookmark collection of a web browser. When clicked, the page
currently open in the browser will be added to the list of existing shorties.

Each Shorty contains a source and a target url. The source url can be used to
be posted in forums, sent inside an email message or whatever. It is typically
shorter than the target url, a full blown web url. But that actually depends
on the target url and the backend used. The target url is the ressource
identified by the shorty. Basic access control is implemented to control the
access of shorties posted to forums or sent per email, but not on a per user or
per group base. Existing shorties can be blocked for usage, set to expire on a
certain date and obviously can be removed permanently again.
