	<description>Shorty Tracking offers an additional tracking feature to
the Shorty app. It records additional details to all clicks being relayed by
Shorty. Collected data can be visualized and filtered interactively.
In addition to that a service (API) allows external packages to use shorty as a
data source for further usage. Amongst this might be statistical evaluation or
visualization.
The Shorty app is a mandatory prerequisite to use this module.
